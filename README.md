# PlazaNpcPreset-Editor
This tool allows you to edit the "PlazaNpcPreset" data inside "PlayerInfo.szs."

# How to use:
- Move your own *PlazaNpcPreset* binary file into the folder with "main.py" and "Output" in it. Then, run main.py.
- Type in the number of the binary file, then enter, then you're able to edit! When you are done editing, type "Done" and it will save the new binary file in "Output/(here)"
- After saving the new PlayerInfo.szs from Switch Toolbox, move it into the folder that "main.py" and "Output" are in. Then run "SzsFix.py". There should be a ".szs" in "Output/(here)" now.
- Put that back in the Static.pack in Toolbox by replacing the old one, and save the Static.pack.
    
## For anyone who looks at the code
This is my first tool, and really my first actual coding project. Because of this, I may have gotten some naming conventions and other such things wrong, so sorry. 

**The code is also a mess. If you have any ideas on what I could add to this, or on how I could improve the code/feel of the tool, feel free to DM me on Discord (@delus1on_l).**
    
# Background
- This is based off my testing and findings of editing "./content/Pack/Static.pack/Etc/PlayerInfo.szs". For more information, [feel free to watch this](https://youtu.be/mj8wDSUWmhE?si=eAKwWFLxdTRx25Dp)
